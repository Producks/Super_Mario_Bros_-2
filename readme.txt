           How to patch
**************************************
You need a clean PRG0 NTSC version of the ROM.
There are 2 different patches, one with the vanilla music and one with the prototype music.
Pick the one you prefer and use it on the PRG0 ROM.
There are also .ips and .bps files. I highly recommend using .bps, but both options work.

        Selectable Characters
**************************************

~ Vanilla Characters ~

They play exactly like in the original game:

Each character has a special ability.
Each character can beat the game warpless by themselves.
But some levels are much harder and take more planning.

**************************************
           2-Player Modes
**************************************

Four 2-player modes are available.
All require a second controller.
Player 2 gets a different palette to make it easier to tell which player is playing.

Traditional:
Players take turns. Death, warping, or level completion swaps the current player.

Tag Team:
Press Select to swap players mid-game. Only the current player can trigger a swap.

Shared Control:
Both players control the same character:
- Player 1: Controls movement.
- Player 2: Controls the A and B buttons.

Chaos Swap:
Swaps players at random intervals without warning.
Swap range: 1 to 16 NES seconds.

**************************************
           Cheat Codes
**************************************

Due to the game's difficulty in certain 2-player modes,
cheats are available to make the game easier.
Cheats are cleared every time you go back to the title screen.

Input these on the title screen with Controller 1:

Always start with 20 lives:
← → ← → ↑ ↓

Start with 7 continues:
B B B B B →
